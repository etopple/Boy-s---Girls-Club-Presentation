<p>Dear Dana,</p>

<p>Thank you for the time you&rsquo;ve invested walking us through both the Redlands and San Bernardino locations, and for your transparency about where things stand with your current IT environment. That kind of honesty makes it possible to build something that actually solves the right problems.</p>

<p>Based on what we&rsquo;ve seen and discussed, the challenge facing BGCIE isn&rsquo;t a single issue &mdash; it&rsquo;s a model issue. The current environment is built around aging servers, VPN-dependent file access, fragmented Microsoft and Adobe licensing, Meraki hardware with 5-year renewal cycles, and a billing structure that charges more every time a device is added. That model creates unpredictable costs, slow resolution times, and growing frustration for you, for Michael, and for staff trying to do their jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Specifically, you shared that:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your server has a dying drive and has been described as &ldquo;old&rdquo; &mdash; with a replacement event on the horizon that could cost $15,000&ndash;$30,000</li>
  <li>Microsoft and Adobe licensing is scattered &mdash; staff are purchasing their own licenses out of pocket, and your IT provider doesn&rsquo;t have visibility into what&rsquo;s deployed</li>
  <li>Outlook stops responding every couple of hours at the San Bernardino office, and the VPN connection is unreliable for remote work</li>
  <li>Basic tasks like laptop swaps &mdash; previously handled at no extra charge &mdash; are now being quoted as billable projects</li>
  <li>Domain renewals, software licensing, and other services are billed separately rather than managed under one relationship</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This proposal doesn&rsquo;t address those problems one at a time. It replaces the model that&rsquo;s creating them.</strong></p>

<p>What we&rsquo;re proposing is a phased project to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Standardize all users on Microsoft 365 Business Premium at nonprofit pricing ($5.78/user/month)</li>
  <li>Migrate files from the server to SharePoint and OneDrive &mdash; eliminating VPN dependency for daily work</li>
  <li>Reset and standardize all endpoints with Entra ID, security baselines, and automatic data protection</li>
  <li>Replace Meraki networking equipment with UniFi at both locations &mdash; removing recurring license renewal costs</li>
  <li>Decommission the file server entirely &mdash; no future replacement event</li>
  <li>Transition to ongoing Premium Managed Services for all 50 users with unlimited remote and onsite support</li>
</ol>

<h2>Addressing the Cost Directly</h2>

<p>We know that BGCIE is currently paying $6,500 per month for managed IT services. Our proposed monthly rate is $7,789. We want to be direct about what accounts for that difference &mdash; and why we believe it represents a reduction in total IT spend, not an increase.</p>

</table>

<p class="footnote">* Staff are currently purchasing Microsoft and Adobe licenses individually, and licensing is not centrally tracked.</p>

<p>The difference between $6,500 and $7,789 is $1,289 per month. That $1,289 accounts for $289 in Microsoft licensing that isn&rsquo;t currently being provided, the migration project work, and a support model that doesn&rsquo;t charge per device or per event. When you factor in the server replacement, Meraki renewals, and per-incident billing that are not included in the current $6,500, the proposed rate represents a lower total cost of IT ownership.</p>

<p><strong>Put simply: you&rsquo;re not paying more for IT. You&rsquo;re paying once, predictably, instead of paying for the same infrastructure problems over and over.</strong></p>

<h2>What This Means for BGCIE Day-to-Day</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Michael&rsquo;s laptop works.</strong> No VPN dependency, no Outlook crashes, no lost Adobe licenses. If a device has a problem, it gets rebuilt in hours &mdash; not weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Staff in San Bernardino have the same experience as Redlands.</strong> Same performance, same access, same reliability &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re in the office, at a school site, or working from home.</li>
  <li><strong>One bill. One provider. Everything managed.</strong> Microsoft, security, devices, networking, and support &mdash; no more separate domain bills, fragmented licensing, or surprise project quotes.</li>
  <li><strong>New hires are productive on day one.</strong> Open the laptop, log in, and everything installs automatically. No procurement quote. No billable hours.</li>
  <li><strong>No more capital surprises.</strong> No server replacement. No Meraki renewal cliffs. No budget volatility. Your monthly number is your actual number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Step</h2>

<p>We understand this is a significant decision, and we respect that you&rsquo;re doing your due diligence. We&rsquo;d welcome the opportunity to walk through this proposal with you and Michael in person so he can ask questions directly and we can ensure nothing gets lost in translation.</p>

<p>The detailed project scopes, infrastructure specifications, managed services inclusions, and payment options follow in the pages ahead.</p>

<p>We appreciate the trust you&rsquo;ve placed in us by sharing as much as you have. We intend to earn the rest of it.</p>
