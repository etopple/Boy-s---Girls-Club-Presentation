# IT Modernization Proposal

**Boys & Girls Clubs of the Inland Empire**

<br>

Prepared by William Pote, CEO
eTop Technology, Inc.
February 2026

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Thank Dana and Michael for their time
- Frame: "This isn't a sales pitch — it's a summary of what we heard, what it means, and what solving it looks like."
- Mention: "We've spent time in both locations and reviewed your current environment in detail."
-->

# What We Heard

Direct feedback from discovery calls with Dana Merola

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Server at Risk** | Dying drive, described as "old." Replacement could cost $15K–$30K. |
| **Outlook Crashes** | San Bernardino staff lose Outlook every couple of hours. VPN unreliable. |
| **License Chaos** | Staff buying own Microsoft & Adobe licenses. Provider can't locate them. |
| **Nickel-and-Diming** | Laptop swaps now $1,500. Domain billed separately. Costs escalating. |
| **Slow Response** | "Very slow going to get answers." Michael hates being on the phone with IT. |
| **Per-Device Billing** | Every new device increases MRC. Growth = higher cost. |

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Go through each one. These are Dana's words, not ours.
- "These aren't IT complaints. These are operational problems that affect how your staff works every day."
- Pause on server risk: "This one has a clock on it. The amber light your tech saw means a drive is failing. When — not if — that server goes down, file access stops for everyone."
- Pause on license chaos: "Your CEO lost Adobe access for months when he switched laptops. Staff are buying their own Microsoft licenses. That's cost leakage and compliance risk."
- If Michael is in the room: "You mentioned you hate being on the phone with IT. That tells us everything about the current support experience."

# This Isn't a Single Problem. It's a Model Problem.

<br>

::left::

### ❌ Current Model

- Server-dependent file access
- VPN required for daily work
- Per-device billing — growth = cost
- 5-year Meraki license renewal cliffs
- Fragmented licensing, no visibility
- Reactive support, slow resolution

::right::

### ✅ Proposed Model

- Cloud-first — no server dependency
- Work from anywhere, no VPN required
- Governance-based pricing — predictable
- UniFi networking — zero renewal fees
- One license, one provider, one bill
- Proactive monitoring & support included

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- THIS IS THE KEY FRAME. Don't rush it.
- "The problems we just listed aren't random. They come from the same root cause: an infrastructure model that was built for a different era."
- "Fixing one issue at a time — replacing the server, re-licensing Adobe, patching the VPN — just keeps the old model alive. And it gets more expensive every year."
- "What we're proposing is replacing the model, not patching it."
- Left column = what you have. Right column = where we take you. Same outcome, different foundation.

# Addressing the Cost Directly

Your current invoice says $6,500. But that's not the full picture.

| | Current (Acorn) | Proposed (eTop) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly managed services | $6,500 | ✅ Included |
| Microsoft 365 licensing (50 users) | ❌ Not standardized | ✅ Included ($289/mo) |
| San Bernardino location support | +$380/mo | ✅ Included |
| Network licensing renewals (Meraki) | ❌ $5K–$10K+ every 5 years | ✅ Eliminated (UniFi) |
| Server replacement reserve | ❌ $15K–$30K pending | ✅ Eliminated |
| Endpoint refresh / laptop swaps | ❌ Quoted per event | ✅ Included |
| Cloud migration project | ❌ Not offered | ✅ Included |
| **EFFECTIVE MONTHLY COST** | **$7,970–$8,770+** | **$7,789** |

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- THIS IS THE MONEY SLIDE. Spend time here.
- "I know the number you see every month is $6,500. Our number is $7,789. I want to be completely transparent about what accounts for that difference."
- Walk the table top to bottom:
  - "$6,500 doesn't include Microsoft licensing — staff are buying their own. We include it. That's $289."
  - "San Bernardino added $380/month to your bill. We include both locations."
  - "The Meraki equipment has 5-year licenses. When those expire, it's $5K–$10K+ to renew. We eliminate that entirely."
  - "Your server needs replacing. That's $15–$30K. We decommission it. No replacement event, ever."
  - "Laptop swaps used to be included. Now they're $1,500 per event. In our model, they're part of the service."
- Bottom line: "When you add up what you're actually spending — not just the invoice number — you're already at $7,970 to $8,770 per month. Our all-in number is $7,789."
- PAUSE. Let that land.
- "You're not paying more for IT. You're paying once, predictably, instead of paying for the same infrastructure problems over and over."

# What We're Proposing

A phased modernization — not a rip-and-replace

| Phase | What | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Microsoft 365 Business Premium | Standardize all 50 users at $5.78/user nonprofit pricing |
| **2** | SharePoint & OneDrive Migration | Move files to the cloud. Eliminate VPN dependency. |
| **3** | Endpoint Reset & Standardization | Clean, secure devices. Data automatically protected. |
| **4** | Network Replacement (Both Locations) | UniFi at Redlands & San Bernardino. Zero renewal licensing. |
| **5** | Server Decommission | No future replacement. Reduced risk surface. |
| **6** | Stabilization & Transition Support | Smooth handoff. Premium managed services begin. |

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- "This is phased intentionally. We don't walk in and flip everything on day one."
- Phase 1: "We start with Microsoft licensing because it unlocks everything else — email migration, file storage, device management, security. At $5.78/user for nonprofit, this is a massive cost advantage."
- Phase 2: "Once licensing is in place, we move your files off the server and into SharePoint and OneDrive. This is what kills the VPN dependency."
- Phase 3: "Every laptop gets wiped, rebuilt, and secured. When someone opens their laptop, they log in and everything is there. If a laptop dies tomorrow, we hand them a new one and they're back in 20 minutes."
- Phase 4: "We replace the Meraki networking at both locations with UniFi. Same enterprise-grade performance, zero recurring license fees."
- Phase 5: "Once everything is migrated and validated, we decommission the server. That $15–$30K replacement event disappears permanently."
- Phase 6: "Post-cutover, we stabilize, tune, and transition into ongoing managed services."

# What Changes Day-to-Day

<br>

**🖥️ Michael's laptop works.**
No VPN dependency, no Outlook crashes, no lost Adobe licenses. Device issues fixed in hours — not weeks.

**👥 Same experience everywhere.**
San Bernardino staff get the same performance as Redlands — office, school site, or home.

**💵 One bill. One provider. Everything managed.**
Microsoft, security, devices, networking, support. No surprise quotes or separate invoices.

**✅ New hires productive on day one.**
Open the laptop, log in, everything installs automatically. No procurement quote. No billable hours.

**📅 No more capital surprises.**
No server replacement. No Meraki renewal cliffs. Your monthly number is your actual number.

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This slide is about making it real. Not technical — operational.
- If Michael is in the room, look at him on the first bullet. "Your laptop works. That's it. No VPN, no crashes, no waiting."
- On "same experience everywhere": "Dana mentioned San Bernardino is the 'little brother' — Outlook crashes, connectivity drops. After this, there's no difference between locations."
- On "one bill": "No more separate domain renewals, no more 'we don't know where your Adobe licenses are,' no more surprise project quotes for laptop swaps."
- On "new hires": "You're a nonprofit. Staff turnover happens. When someone starts, they don't wait three days for IT to set them up. They open the laptop and go."
- On "capital surprises": "Michael, you told Dana you don't want to be surprised by IT costs. This is how that stops."

# Why This Is the Right Moment

<br>

### $15–$30K — Server replacement is coming.
The current server has a dying drive. Replacing it means spending $15–$30K to keep the old model alive.

### $5.78 — Nonprofit licensing is a strategic asset.
Business Premium at nonprofit pricing is dramatically under market rate. It funds the entire modernization.

### 60% — Continuity is already failing.
Outlook crashes every couple of hours in San Bernardino. Staff and leadership feel it daily.

### $0 — Renewal cliffs are eliminated.
UniFi networking removes Meraki's 5-year license renewal cycle permanently.

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- "There are four reasons this is the right time — not next quarter, not next year."
- Server: "You're going to spend $15–$30K on a new server to keep the same model that's causing the problems. Or you spend that energy moving to a model where servers don't exist in your environment."
- Nonprofit pricing: "At $5.78/user, you're getting a $22 commercial license for under $6. That single decision funds the migration — SharePoint, OneDrive, Intune, Defender, device management. All of it."
- Continuity: "Dana described 60% continuity at San Bernardino. Outlook crashes. VPN drops. That's staff time wasted every single day."
- Renewals: "Meraki licenses expire. When they do, you pay again for the privilege of using equipment you already bought. UniFi doesn't work that way."

# Investment Summary

<br>

### Recommended Option: 36-Month Term

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| Monthly Managed Services + M365 Licensing (50 users) | **$9,039/month** |
| One-Time Migration & Infrastructure Project | **$24,596.53** |

<br>

### Alternative: GreatAmerica Lease (36 months, $1 buyout)

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| All-In Monthly (services + project amortized) | **$8,370.33/month** |

<br>

*Both options include: full migration project, UniFi networking at both locations, Microsoft 365 Business Premium for all 50 users, endpoint reset, server decommission, and Premium Managed Services.*

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Lead with the term option. "This is the recommended path: $9,039/month for managed services and licensing, plus a one-time project cost of $24,596.53 for the migration and infrastructure."
- "If cash flow flexibility matters, we also have a lease option through GreatAmerica at $8,370.33/month all-in — that rolls the project cost into the monthly payment. 36 months, $1 buyout, zero advance payments."
- IMPORTANT: Connect back to the comparison. "Remember, when we normalize for everything Acorn doesn't include — the licensing, the server replacement, the Meraki renewals, the per-event billing — your effective current cost is $7,970 to $8,770/month. This is in that same range, but with the migration project and infrastructure replacement included."
- "After the 36-month term, the project cost is paid off and your ongoing monthly drops to just managed services and licensing."

# Next Step

<br>

We'd welcome the opportunity to walk through this proposal in detail with Dana and Michael — in person — so every question gets answered directly.

<br>

### What that looks like:

1. **Review this proposal together** — confirm the numbers, the scope, the timeline
2. **Answer Michael's questions directly** — no telephone game, no lost context
3. **Agree on a start date** — or identify what else you need to make a decision

<br>

> *"We appreciate the trust you've placed in us by sharing as much as you have. We intend to earn the rest of it."*
>
> — William Pote, CEO, eTop Technology

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- If presenting to Dana alone: "Dana, we know you're the one who brings proposals to Michael. We want to make sure you have everything you need to present this confidently — but we'd also love to sit with both of you so Michael can ask questions directly."
- If Michael is present: "Michael, what questions do you have? What would you need to see to move forward?"
- Close with: "Based on what you've shared, the logical next step is a technical discovery session where our engineering team validates the environment, confirms the scope, and locks in a project timeline. That takes about 2 hours on-site."
- Final frame: "This is not a vendor switch. This is a risk profile shift. The question isn't whether IT costs $6,500 or $7,789 — it's whether you keep funding infrastructure risk or transition to a model that removes it."
